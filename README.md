## Introduction

The Daily Planner App is a simple web application that helps you keep track of your daily tasks and appointments. It features a clean, easy-to-use interface that lets you add, edit, and delete events quickly and easily.

## Features

The Daily Planner App comes with a variety of features designed to help you manage your work day, including:

- **Customizable time blocks:** The app allows you to add and edit events for each hour of your work day. You can add as many events as you need, and the app will automatically update the time blocks to reflect your schedule.

- **Dark mode:** The app features a dark mode that makes it easier to use in low-light conditions. Simply toggle the dark mode switch to turn it on or off.

- **Automatic color coding:** The app automatically colors each time block based on the current time. Past events are colored gray, current events are colored red, and future events are colored green.

- **Event persistence:** The app stores your events in local storage, so they remain even after you close the app. This makes it easy to pick up where you left off.

- **Toastr notifications:** The app uses Toastr to display notifications when you save an event. This lets you know that your event was successfully saved.
